      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Fawzi (pronounced 'Foezi') Alami! I have been a computer programmer for a very (very) long time. I am attending this camp because I always want to learn, and although I'm knowledgeable with web technologies, I'm no expert but would love to become one!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Jordan, but lived my early years in Kuwait. I moved to the states in 1980. I've lived in Detroit, Arkansas, and have been living in Texas since 1990.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my spare time, I like to play tennis, run, walk, and go to the movies.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Full-Stack Developer!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Plano, where I've resided since 1996.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>In addition to the fact that I love, and are fascinated by the technology, I love making interfaces where users can easily interact with components on the screen, and that simplifies whatever task the users are working on!</p>
